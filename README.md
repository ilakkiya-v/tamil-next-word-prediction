# tamil-next-word-prediction
In our project we build a quality word embedding and try to predict the next word when the word is given as an input. The Word2Vec models (namely, skip-gram and CBOW) are used to create Tamil word embeddings on An English-Tamil Parallel Corpus created by Loganathan Ramasamy.
